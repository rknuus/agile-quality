In link:../../../2019/11/30/feature-teams-are-cheaper-and-faster.html[Feature teams are cheaper and faster] I made a strong case for feature teams. After taking an link:https://www.gotoacademy.nl/collections/architecture-with-agility-kevlin-henney[Architecture with Agility masterclass] hosted by Kevlin Henney I revised my view.

The arguments presented link:../../../2019/11/30/feature-teams-are-cheaper-and-faster.html[earlier] are based on the failure mode of component teams: that delays can propagate through the organization and that consequently the need for management grows superlinearly.

But feature teams are not a link:https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.117.315[silver bullet]. Feature teams have a failure mode, too. Feature teams might require a broad set of skills, which can be overwhelming and lead to low throughput or poor quality because a generalist can't dedicate the same amount of time to a particular skill as a specialist.

So it depends on your particular context whether a component team or a feature team makes more sense. The link:https://www.gotoacademy.nl/collections/architecture-with-agility-kevlin-henney[masterclass] nicely demonstrated why it is crucial to design your organization link:http://www.melconway.com/Home/pdf/committees.pdf["according to the need for communication"] (Melvin Conway). Some organization design criteria could be:

.selection of criteria pro/contra feature teams
[%header]
|===
| criterion | favors

| features require common skillset
| feature team

| features require broad skillset
| component team

| features require deep domain knowledge
| feature team

| features require deep component knowledge
| component team

| high need for communication about feature
| feature team

| high need for communication about skill
| component team

| faster business value delivery
| feature team

| higher code quality
| component team

| minimize WIP, handovers, and delays
| feature team

|===

This relativization should be considered when reading Ron Jeffries' book https://pragprog.com/book/rjnsd/the-nature-of-software-development[The Nature of Software Development], because he focuses on the strengths of feature team and the weaknesses of component teams, but doesn't cover the full picture.
