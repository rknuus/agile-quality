- use <<canvas,OKRs Brainstorming Canvas>> to discover goals and elaborate OKRs
  - prefer lead measures over lag measures, because lead measures can tell you whether you are moving right from the beginning on
  - defining _Key Results_ is a challenge the first few times, just define the best ones you can for now and move on, you can change them if necessary along the way
