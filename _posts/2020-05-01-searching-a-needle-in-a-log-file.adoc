If you receive a defect report with a log file and instructions how to reproduce the issue on a customer system, you take a look at the log file first. If the log file is big searching manually doesn't cut the mustard. For large enough log files even a decent log file viewer might not be good enough, e.g. if you need to identify lines with identical message IDs. So what to do about it?

Python's link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/[generator expressions] could be a tool worth adding to your belt. In a nutshell a generator expression is a way to iterate over lazily-evaluated data and to apply map-reduce operations. Let's just have a look at an example:

```python
def f(line):
  return line.replace('foo', 'bar')

def g(line):
  return line[::-1]  # reverses the line

with open('some logfile') as logfile:
  lines = (line for line in logfile)  ## <1>
  reduced_lines = (line for line in lines if 'foo' in line)  ## <2>
  mapped_lines = (f(line) for line in reduced_lines)  ## <3>
  lines = (g(line) for line in mapped_lines if 'non' in line)  ## <4>
  for line in lines:  ## <5>
    print(line)
```
<1> The basic structure is like a slightly rearranged and compacted for-loop: +
    `(<iterator-based return value> for <iterator> in <range>)`
<2> To reduce simply add `if <condition>` after the for-loop
<3> Mapping is done by modifying the `<iterator-based return value>`, e.g. by calling a function on it
<4> Map and reduce combined
<5> You can iterate once over a generator expression

link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/[Generator expressions] can be chained, i.e. a link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/[generator expression] can be fed with elements of another link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/[generator expression]. Thanks to lazy evaluation only the currently used elements must be loaded to memory. That's why this approach works reasonably fast for large files.

When applying link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/[generator expressions] on log files you can extract specific information and -- for instance -- generate a link:https://plantuml.com[diagram] to visualize matching lines with identical message IDs. Two caveats I'd like to point out: You can consume a generator expression once and only once. And you need to pick up link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming[functional programming].
