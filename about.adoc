This is the personal blog of mailto:rknuus@gmail.com[rknuus]. It covers topics which I used to understand to a certain degree at some point in time. The topics are related to agile software development and software quality. Most topics are inspired by books, talks, and podcasts. I aim to keep 4 out of 5 articles short, let's say less than 256 words.

Feedback is warmly welcome. But I decided against providing comments. So please send me an mailto:rknuus@gmail.com[email] instead. Thanks.
